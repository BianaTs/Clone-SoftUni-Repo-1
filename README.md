Sliding puzzles are mechanical devices made of blocks of wood or plastic set into a frame as well as simple but addictive computer games that improve your problem-solving skills. The pieces are usually simple shapes or imprinted with colors, patterns, sections of a bigger picture, numbers, or letters.  Sliding puzzles, also known as sliders or sliding-block puzzles, are different from rearrangement puzzles in that the pieces cannot be lifted or removed from the frame. To win, you have to arrange them in a specific pattern by sliding them into certain routes on the board. Each move opens a new path and rearranges the pieces, so you have to plan carefully in order to achieve the end configuration.
